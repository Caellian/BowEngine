Core engine:

Rendering engine:
- Add global lighting
- Add shadow system
    Could do this by rendering objects from "Sun" perspective and project them on objects behind/below.

Physics engine:
- Make gravity position dependant
- Is collision going to be handled by games?
    - Should I make presets?
        - Simple geometric primitives collision
        - Complex mesh collision


Audio engine:
- Create one -> look at OpenAL
